# 2D Physics Engine

## Introduction
Created a 2D physics engine using Javascript, taking help from the book "Building a 2D Game
Physics Engine Using HTML5 and JavaScript" by Michael Tanaya, Huaming Chen, Jebediah Pavleas, Kelvin Sung.

This Physics Engine simulates physics between 2 basic shapes Circles and Rectangles.
I also added some scenes to the engine.


### Note
- Had Zero prior knowledge about this project so, some of the formulae were taken from the above book.
- For someone who wants to make a all-rounded versatile physics engine I suggest checkout the book by "Game Physics Engine Development 2nd Edition" by Ian Millington.
